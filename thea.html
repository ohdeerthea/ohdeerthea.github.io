            <h2>Character Bio</h2>
            <p>Thea is a spirited adventurer whose mysterious past has led her through countless magical realms and treacherous dungeons. Born in a small village on the edge of the known world, she discovered her latent magical abilities during a devastating attack that claimed her hometown. This tragedy forged her into the formidable warrior she is today - one who fights not just with blade and spell, but with an unwavering determination to protect those who cannot protect themselves.</p>
            
            <p>Despite the darkness in her past, Thea maintains a heart of gold and an infectious optimism that draws allies to her cause. Her quick wit and natural leadership abilities have saved her party countless times, whether through clever strategy or her uncanny ability to find hope in the darkest situations. She wields both sword and sorcery with equal skill, preferring versatile combat styles that allow her to adapt to any threat.</p>
            
            <p>When not adventuring, Thea can often be found in taverns sharing tales of her journeys, always with a drink in hand and a smile on her face. Her collection of artwork captures both her fierce combat prowess and these quieter, more intimate moments that reveal the depth of her character.</p>
